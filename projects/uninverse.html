                I contributed to the research and development of a <b>multi-speaker TTS system capable of 
                generating the voices of approximately 100 artists within a single TTS system.</b> 
                These TTS systems are utilized in the following two services included in UNIVERSE, which is a K-pop fan community platform serviced by NCSOFT. <br>

                    The K-pop artists create posts with photos and brief comments, similar to Instagram, 
                    and our TTS system reads these comments aloud in the respective artists' voices. <br>

                UNIVERSE offeres simulated phone calls to fans featuring their favorite artists' voices. 
                Our TTS system is employed to generate these lifelike artist phone calls.
